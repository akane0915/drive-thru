# Asia's Drive Through

- I chose to build the application using Rails and Postgres including using Rails views for the front-end because I wanted to be sure I had an MVP by the deadline.  My intent was to refactor using React for the front-end, but I did not have enough time to do so.  The application includes unit tests using rspec.

Includes:
- React-Rails gem
- Unit testing (rspec)
- Postgres

- For further exploration, I plan to incorporate the following:
  - AJAX
    - Please view this project as an example of my use of AJAX
      - https://github.com/akane0915/higher-grounds-coffee3
  - User Integration Testing
  - React and ES6
    - Please view this project as an example of my use of React
